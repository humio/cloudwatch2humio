# CloudWatch2Humio
This repository contains a set of lambdas for shipping Cloudwatch Logs and Metrics to Humio.

The full documentation regarding installing and using this integration can be found in the official [humio docs](https://docs.humio.com/integrations/platforms/aws-cloudwatch/).

## Vision
The vision for the CloudWatch to Humio integration, is to create a bridge between Humio and AWS, which enables users to ingest logs and metrics from the AWS CloudWatch service, so that Humio can be used to manage this data.
